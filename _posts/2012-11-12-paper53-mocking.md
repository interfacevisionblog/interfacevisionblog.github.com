## Introduction

We really want to have an amazing user experience. We've mocked up different stuff over the years. Recently, I happened upon [Paper 53](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper). It is really easy to be creative with this product.

Special thanks to [Brian Foote](mailto:sharpguru@gmail.com) for helping out with these mockups.

### Connectors

  </p>
</div>

Connecting between parts should show the direction of flow of a program and feel like connectors. They should also give the user hints as to what types of parts can be hooked up with other parts.

### Parts

  </p>
</div>

Parts need to be easy to use. A user should be-able to understand the purpose of a part and how to hook it up with other parts.

### Cards

Cards are a special type of part.

<div class="pagination-centered img-polaroid">
  <p>
    <img src="/assets/img/vision_ux_card_scope_2.jpg" alt="">
  </p>
</div>

Cards are able to hold other parts. The above mockup is a scope card. A user can drop new variables into the variables section. The tasks to run, within the scope, are contained within the action area.

### Using Cards and Parts

We are trying to find an easy way for people to configure parts. 
<div class="pagination-centered img-polaroid">
  <p>
    <img src="/assets/img/vision_ux_card_config_2.png" alt="">
  </p>
</div>

In this example, the user has a variable called size with a value of 5. The red arrow means they dragged and dropped that part into the left side of an if statement.

## Mocking in Google Docs

Even though Paper 53 is a great way to mock we do need to start finalizing the look and feel. Since we are trying to design custom controls, we decided to use Google Docs.

<div class="pagination-centered img-polaroid">
  <p>
    <img src="/assets/img/vision_ux_card_dowhile_2.png" alt="">
  </p>
</div>

## Conclusion

We have a long way to go in making the perfect UX for visually developing software. Feedback is always appreciated.
