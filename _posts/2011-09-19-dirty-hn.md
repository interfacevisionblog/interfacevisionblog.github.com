I now feel dirty for trying to work with a startup on Hacker news. Or should I?

## Why?

I ran into a Show HN post about an interesting startup called Tinyproj. I posted a short project on Tinyproj because I like to work with like minded people: entrepreneurs.

Then comes a post from a pseudonymous named Edward Case ([http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3015677](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3015677), [http://www.betabeat.com/2011/09/19/why-80-percent-of-web-projects-are-total-bullshit-a-freelancers-rant/](http://www.betabeat.com/2011/09/19/why-80-percent-of-web-projects-are-total-bullshit-a-freelancers-rant/)).

(Edit: Note the short project description was supposed to be private and Edward Case did not have permission to make it public as was done in their blog)

## I’m Not Anonymous

I have no reason to be anonymous. My name is Eric Hosick. I’ve been programming since I was 13. I’ve written hundreds of thousands of lines of code. I’ve lectured at a college for a few years in IT and BIS. I’ve started a few companies: even a few offshore. I’ve been successful and I’ve failed: both quite a few times now.

So, when someone, anonymously, says something like this:

“I’m sure I’m not the only programmer that can sniff out a fake nerd.” – Edward Case
  
And tries to oust me call me out as that fake nerd. Well. Ya. You’ve got a lot to learn about people on Hacker News. Generally, we know our shit.

## The 1000 Char Limit

I was limited to 1000 characters on Tinyproj. I did have more detailed requirements. The 1000 char limit was a pain, I have to say, and I was going to quickly give up on Tinyproj. But I am going to have to give cudos to Tinyproj for getting out that Minimal Viable Product. Good on you! It was the right move. So, I stuck in there.

I clipped off most of the requirements. I knew anyone really interested would just ask for more detail.

And it was worth it, because the entrepreneur has been really helpful.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading.

If you are interested in working with someone who is and respects programmers, please do drop a line.

I think I have some rather amazing stuff coming down the pipeline.
