## Introduction

Around late May, 2012, [Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) came to the Ruby Forum in Ho Chi Minh City. I found out he was interested in new languages, so I made a quick presentation and "pitched" to him while he was here.

His response was really positive. To paraphrase, using my bad memory, he found the technology to be impressive and hopes it doesn't become a "toy language". That is my hope too.

## The Presentation

I used high resolution images so the presentation may take a while to load.
