# COO Of East Agile

Recently I was made the COO of [East Agile](http://www.eastagile.com). What is interesting about Agile is that you can fit most of the concepts on a few pieces of paper: the agile rules as you will. It is, or should be, really easy.

I’ve had a chance to observe some of the companies that practice Agile on a large scale (involving 50 to 100 employees). As advanced as they were at Agile, I was surprised to see that they only apply a small part of Agile to their entire process. They were doing a great job but I saw a lot of room for improvement.

I think I could say that East Agile is ahead of most people in the “Agile” game. But it isn’t easy staying agile. In fact, it is really hard to do. Below are some examples why.

Oh, but if you haven’t read it yet, please see my blog on [Agile branding](/Agile/agile-branding/).

# An Agile Master Is Always Needed

I was lucky enough to be trained by [Mike Cohn](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/) and his classes on being a Scrum Master and Estimation (I highly recommend his classes on estimation). I though that being an Agile Master would require some training of the Team initially. However, what I have found is that you have to continually observe and make suggestions on how to apply Agile itself.

## Planning Poker Example

A quick example is the Estimation process and planning poker. I’ve chatted with our different teams about Estimation and the dangers of contamination when estimation. Contamination is when one person in the team (or a product owner or stake holder) provides an estimate before other people have had a chance to think about the estimate themselves. This taints the estimate.

Often times, team members seem to “get into” the estimation process and yell out estimates during the Iteration Planning meeting. So, from time to time, I have to remind people to not “yell out the estimate”. Of course, eventually I pull out the poker playing [cards](http://store.mountaingoatsoftware.com/) to stop this from happening.

Initially, it feels a little funny to use cards to do planning. However, it becomes obvious very quickly that estimation gets out of hand without them.

## Product Owner and the Team

Sometimes I will see the team working on a story that was not estimated. When asked why, the say “Oh, the product owner said we don’t have to estimate.” Ahhh. Ummm. Another time, product owners have said we don’t need to do BDD or TDD on this because we just need to “get it out”.

# Conclusion

If you want to run a company that uses Agile you are going to need an Agile Master. That Agile Master needs to stay on their toes at all times. Of course, this means that their training is going to come in almost all the time. The most important part of that training being communication and allowing teams to form naturally. However, at the same time remembering that you need to keep people on the Agile path.
