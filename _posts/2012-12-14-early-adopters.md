I've given a few "pitches" before, but never one like this.

I asked for a little information on their background and what they needed in educational software: just to make sure I was on the right track.

While sharing my desktop remotely, I went over the mockups.

### Within Two Minutes

The people on the other side were showing more enthusiasm than I'd ever been able to muster up.

### Within Five Minutes

They had a better understanding of what we had than I did.

### Within Ten Minutes

I was ready to buy our product from them.

### Within 24 Hours

They were asking other potential early adopters their thoughts.


I now understand what an early adopter really is and how valuable they are to any startup.
