## Introduction

I don't think I can emphasize enough the damage specialization of behavioral interface has caused the software industry.

The result of specialization of behavioral interface has been hundreds of incompatible software frameworks and hundreds-of-thousands of unique sub-routines.

The solution Generalizing the interface 

One simple idea can fix all of this: standardize behavior interface .

## 

Specialization is the act of defining something in a very specific way. 


Behavior/Process/Algorithms/Logic/Action/Doing encapsulated 

Data/Meta-Data/Data Structures/Information


Communication/Access/Retrieval - A behavior in itself.


The act of coding involves accessing information required to run an algorithm.






Communication of information between data and behavior.
