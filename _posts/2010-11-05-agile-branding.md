# Branding and Agile

I wanted to quickly talk about agile and branding.

Instead of using branded names like XP and Scrum, I thought I would try to generalise terms coined by these great systems. I took the advice of [Mike Cohn](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/) on this. So, for example, Scrum Master at East Agile is Agile Master. Daily Scrum is the Daily Planning Meeting. A sprint is an Iteration, etc.

I did this because I wanted to focus on what makes Agile great – The Agile tools. Agile itself is a collection of the best of best known practices. In fact, there is nothing “new” about agile per-se other than Agile brought together this best of the best known practices.

Here is a list of why I removed the branding from Agile:

* Generalizing the terms made it easier for me to iteratively implement and introduce new Agile processes.
* Misconceptions or bad experiences with some of the brand made people uncomfortable with implementing them.
* Can pick and choose from different “brands” like XP, Crystal and Scrum without confusion.

# Credit Where Credit is Due

I do want to point out that I have great respect for those who created the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). In no way do I want lesson their contribution to software engineering and the community as a whole.

# Conclusion

If you are going to apply Agile in your company, try and generalise terms so you can pull the best from each brand. Implement Agile tools and processes iteratively. Don’t allow any “bad experiences” with Agile hold you back.

Remember to pay tribute to the original twelve.
